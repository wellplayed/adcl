#AlphaDraft Challenger League

##Game Rules
###Punctuality of Players

###Choice of Side
 - During league play, first choice of side will be decided by coin toss
 - Teams will switch sides between games
 
### Game of Record
  - Game of record (“GOR”) refers to a game where all ten players have loaded and which has progressed to a point of meaningful interaction between opposing teams. Once a game has attained GOR status, the period ends in which incidental restarts may be permitted and a game will be considered as “official” from that point onward. After the establishment of GOR, game restarts will be allowed only under limited conditions (see Section 4.5) Examples of conditions which establish GOR:
  
    - A player has obtained a creep score greater than zero (0).
    - A player has died to a player, turret, minion or monster.
    - Game timer reaches two (2) minutes.

###Stoppage of Play
  - Players may only pause a match immediately following any of the events described below.
    - Unintentional disconnection
    - Hardware or software malfunction
    - Player illness
  - Pause Allowance. Teams may pause the game for a maximum of fifteen (15) minutes over the course of a single game. Pausing beyond allowance time will be considered unfair play and penalties will be applied at the discretion of tournament officials.
  
###Game Restart
  - **Restarts Before GOR**
    - A player’s runes or mastery settings have not applied correctly between the game lobby and match in a way that cannot be adjusted within the game, then a game may be restarted.
  - **Restarts After GOR**
    - If a game experiences a critical bug at any point during the match which significantly alters game stats or gameplay mechanics, then a game may be restarted.
  - In the event of a restart, players are required to keep the same picks, bans, and summoner spells.

##Player Equipment Responsibility.
  - All players are responsible for ensuring the performance of their chosen setup, including computer hardware and peripherals, internet connection, and power. A problem with player equipment is not an acceptable reason for lateness or pausing beyond a team’s allowance, regardless of the root cause of the problem.

##Restrictions on Gameplay Elements
Restrictions may be added at any time before or during a match if there are known bugs with any items, champions, skins, runes, masteries, or Summoner spells, or for any other reason as determined at the discretion of tournament officials
Champions who have not been available on the live service for more than 2 weeks will be automatically restricted.
