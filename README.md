### Game of Record
  - Game of record (“GOR”) refers to a game where all ten players have loaded and which has progressed to a point of meaningful interaction between opposing teams. Once a game has attained GOR status, the period ends in which incidental restarts may be permitted and a game will be considered as “official” from that point onward. After the establishment of GOR, game restarts will be allowed only under limited conditions (see Section 4.5) Examples of conditions which establish GOR:
  
    - A player has obtained a creep score greater than zero (0).
    - A player has died to a player, turret, minion or monster.
    - Game timer reaches two (2) minutes.

###Game Restart
  - **Restarts Before GOR**
    - A player’s runes or mastery settings have not applied correctly between the game lobby and match in a way that cannot be adjusted within the game, then a game may be restarted.
  - **Restarts After GOR**
